mips-midi
=========

An old university project that plays binary files converted from midi.

This uses a modified version of the MARS project found here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/ and the binary has been included in this repo.

To play just open the midiPlayer.asm into MARS, compile it and type the binary file name (provided in the repo as well).
